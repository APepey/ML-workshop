# Understanding malaria transmission and vectors ecology in Cambodia through machine learning

## Description

An open-source project analysing malaria vectors ecology in Cambodia using machine learning, based on data collected during my PhD, motivated by my will to participate to universal access to knowledge, support open science, and f**k Elsevier et al.
Anyone is free to participate, even though the data is already a few years old and it is a pretty niche interest. I just believe in open data, and who knows, it might be useful to someone.

- Collection dates: 2019-2020
